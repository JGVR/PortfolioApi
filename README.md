It serves as the backbone for user interfaces that display comprehensive portfolio information, including work experiences and projects, tailored for individuals looking to showcase their professional journey. Unique to our API is the integration of a sophisticated Chatbot, powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-4 model, which acts as a personal assistant, enriching user interaction with instant, intelligent responses to inquiries. Developed with **django, pymongo, socketIo**, this API offers an unparalleled blend of functionality and user engagement.
